# Various scripts to make work easier

This repository contains my personal dotfiles and configuration for unix/posix
shells and coomand line tools in general. Feel free to use them if you find
anything useful.

A couple of years ago I migrated from bash to zsh. All scripts and snippets should
be compatible with both shells, but some bugs might appear as I don't
actively verify outside my own environment on a day to day basis.

Feel free to use or contribute if you come across this repo by accident.
Currently this repo contains the following scripts:

## Install

1. Run the install.sh script

```
$ ./install.sh
```
